## Game Story

The story begins with the protagonist (PC) lying dead at the center of the screen, wondering why he can still think despite being deceased. Using his newfound power to rewind time, he returns to the morning of his death and starts investigating his mother's disappearance at the behest of his sister. 

The journey takes the PC from his office to a university, where visual novel-style interactions reveal clues, to escape room-like puzzles in his mother’s office, and finally to a stealth-based infiltration of a government laboratory. The game culminates in the revelation of the PC’s origins and a confrontation with his past.
